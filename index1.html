            We can all contribute in small ways by reducing our personal carbon footprint to help mitigate
            the speed and effects <br>of climate change. Here are some ideas of changes we can make in our
            lives that have an impact.</br>

    <h1 class="p4"><b>What can we do to slow climate change?</b></h1>
   <p class="p5"> 
    There are many online lists of actions you can take to help slow climate change – we’ll
cover some of them on this page. <br>We hope you’ll spot one or two that fit into your
lifestyle or circumstances, or prompt you to find out more.</br>
   </p>
   <br></br>
   <br></br>
   <h2 class="p6"><b>1. Change your diet</b></h2>
   <p class="p7">
    A diet rich in plant-based foods is a good choice when it comes to contributing to
reducing climate change. In fact, it’s estimated that by reducing your consumption of
animal protein by half, you can cut your diet’s carbon footprint by more than 40%
Beef production alone requires 20 times more land and emits 20 times more greenhouse
gas emissions per unit of edible protein than common plant-based proteins such as beans,
peas and lentils.<br>It’s not just the (now infamous) cows’ burping of methane gasses that is the problem! The
diet that is often fed to livestock – maize and soy – are potential sources of food in
themselves. Meanwhile, animals require a lot of water and other resources, and some of
the land used for livestock is the result of clearing forests.
You don’t need to go vegetarian or vegan to make a difference. Small shifts in diet
choices can make a huge impact globally and having a more flexible diet as a ‘flexitarian’
can really help.</br>
Buying local, seasonal produce is a great idea too – it cuts down on the energy used to
transport and store your food before it hits your plate.

   <h2 class="p9"><b>2. Travel smarter</b></h2>
   <p class="p10">
       Over the last couple of years, led by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Zoom meeting has
       become a new concept reducing physical travel, but virtual working can also reduce
       carbon emissions.<br>Getting rid of your car can reduce your emissions by about a quarter of the average yearly
       emissions contributed by each person in the developed world. Choosing the most efficient
       vehicle and going electric where possible can make a big difference.
       Flying less has an even greater impact. A transatlantic round-trip by air releases about 1.6
       tonnes of CO2 – that’s almost as much as the average annual emissions of many people in
       the developing world.<br>There’s no need to become a hermit or forgo all overseas travel. Start by looking at your
       usual schedule and identifying opportunities where you can make small, regular changes
       that add up to something bigger. For example, maybe you could cycle to work once a
       week, rather than driving.</br>

    <h2 class="p12"><b>3. Share the voices of those on the front line of climate change</b></h2>
    <br></br>
    <p class="p11">The stories and articles we share with friends and family via email or social media make
a difference. If you see an interesting social media post about climate change or green
solutions, share it so folks in your network see it too.<br>Every week, we bring you stories of people living in communities on the front line of
climate change. People like Melanio (pictured) in Peru. Floods, made worse by climate
change, were damaging lives and livelihoods in Melanio’s community. He learned that
reforestation could protect from flooding by strengthening the soil and slowing flood
waters. Now he’s joining with others to plant trees and restore the natural habitat.
</br>
Help spread the word about the impact of the climate crisis on those hardest hit by
sharing stories like Melanio’s with your network. Sharing the problems people face can
help raise awareness of the issues, but also of local solutions that work, which can help
these ideas spread.</p>
