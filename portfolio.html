    <b> What is climbirds ? </b> <br></br>
    <p> Climbirds is a non-profit organisation made to help climate change and stop it completely. <br>We help spread awareness about the situation and what it is and how it impacts us in the form of websites, webinars and online seminars.  </br>
        And also help run charities to plant trees, clean oceans and do other things that can help slow down climate change. </p><img src="https://github.com/TeamClimateCHANGE/TeamClimateChangeSDG13/blob/main/Untitled.png?raw=true" float="right" class="img1"></img>

            <br><b class="h1"> Why slow down climate change? </b> </br>
            <br> <p class="h2">  If we don’t take action on climate change then the earth’s atmosphere will heat up and so will the soil. 
                <br> The earth won't be able to support many species of animals and wildlife thus, they will die out. <br>This will break the delicate balance on which the earth and its ecosystem survives and thus many <br>more species will die out and human survival will decrease a lot too.</br>That is why we need to stop climate change and global warming.</br>

       <div class="content1">
       <br> <p>Climbirds organised Climacon in December 2019 which aimed to teach ordinary people about global warming  <br>and climate change and help them get to know ways to take action against it.</br>
        Along with this many people also had the chance to join our organisation and along with this many celebrities attended the event, too </p></br>

            <b><i> Earthsavers</i></b>
    <br></br>
    <p>When covid struck the world and everyone was in lockdown, we took the chance to spread once more.<br>We did online webinars that were done in schools while online schooling was going on.</br> Through these webinars we taught the coming generation about climate change and ways through which they could help. We made them realise<br>that it was up to them to ensure the stopping of climate change and the fate of our planet.</br> </p>

        <b><i>Charitree</i></b>
        <br></br>
    
           <p>Through this charity, people could donate money ,even as little as 1 rupee, which could be
            utilised to plant trees.<br>This charity ran from 2020 to 2021 and during this time people had
            donated 2 crore rupees and 18 million trees were planted. <br>This actually helped carbon
            emissions by quite a bit, and was one our most successful operations.</br></br>

    <br><b><i>Global cleanup</i></b></br> 

    <br><p>Thai charity was to clean all the destruction caused as a side effect of climate change. <br>This
        involved cleaning the oceans of trash, cleaning the forest where pollution is happening ,and
        stopping oil leaks and helping <br>clean coral reefs and help them grow. <br>This requires more
        donations than planting trees, but we got lots of donations and we also used money freely given
        by our own members. <br>In total, we cleaned 2 million kilos of trash from the ocean,<br>cleaned 50
        thousand kilos of trash from many forests around the world and stopped around 200 major oil leaks from around the world
    .<br>And helps many reefs both small and big, become protected and become larger</br></br></br> </br></br></br>
